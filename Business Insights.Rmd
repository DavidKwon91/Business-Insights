#Assumptions

#To clarify and to avoid confusion of the understanding of the dataset,

#First Assumption:::::
#I assume that..

#"Non-Customers" variable is the customers who don't buy drink
#"Customers" variable is the customers who buy drink
#in both tables. 

#Second Assumption:::::
#I assume that..

#Since the client company, named Brawndo, is the "children's electrolyte drink company," I assume that the future target customer is the children, which is Age Range "0-18." 

#Another assumption in here is that this dataset doesn't depend on the fact that parents don't buy the drink for children.

#Since the dataset has only 1 observation for "Drinking Places (alcoholic Beverages)," 
#we may not consider "Drinking Places (alcoholic Beverages)"
#Also, as the assumptions above, our future target customers are children, which is Age Range 0-18, 
#we don't have to consider this observation. 



#Manipulating the table1 to create new variables which is the following;

#the proportion of Non-Customers by Age Range
#the proportion of Customers by Age Range

#the proportional number of Non-Customers by Age Range and by Chain
#the proportional number of Customers by Age Range and by Chain

#We can notice that the Chains of Top 10 and Worst 10 for the number of customers are differenet with the Chains of Top 10 and Worst 10 for the sales rate. 

#We also can notice that some Chain are in the top 10 and worst 10 for the number of customers, such as Subway, CVS, Starbucks US, McDonald's, Walgreens, Taco Bell, Burger King US, or Chick-fill-A.

#This result is from the fact that those chains have the most number of customers. 
#Therefore, regardsless of sales rate, since they have the most number of customers, they are accounting for top 10 and worst 10. 

#This insight will be helpful to increase the sales volume.
